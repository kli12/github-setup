Please answer the following questions:


1. Where is your hometown?
Arlington, Texas


2. What is your favorite local restaurant?
This is a hard one!! I really love Matsuri for sushi, and Sweet Dogs for the most amazing interesting hot dogs. I also love POC because it's such a great buffet. Whisk is delicious too! I can't pick.



3. Name the last good book you read (title, author?).
Well, I technically re-read it, but I recently re-read the entire Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling.


4. Which album/artist is in heavy rotation on your iPod/iPhone/MP3 player/stream?
THIS IS SO HARD. I listen to so much music, and I mostly use Soundcloud. I would say I have been listening to a lot of Flume and various future bass artists in general.


5. If you were to build a web site for fun, what would it be about?
It would be a personal website detailing my love of food, animals, beauty and travels. Maybe reviews and just everyday blog entries.
